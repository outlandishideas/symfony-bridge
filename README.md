# Symfony 2 Event Bridge for WordPress

This is a small WordPress plugin which translates WordPress's `init` hook to a Symfony event so that bundles 
can modify WP admin pages.

It is likely to only be of use in combination with the 
[Symfony WordPress Edition](https://github.com/outlandishideas/symfony-wordpress-edition).
